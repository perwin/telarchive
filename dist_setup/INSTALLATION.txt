** INSTALLATION:

* Really Simple Installation:

1. Unpack the .tar.gz archive (you've probably already done that)

2. cd to the resulting telarchive-1.x directory

3. A. For a standard system-wide installation (assuming you have root 
privileges):
   $ python setup.py install

OR:

3. B. For a personal installation into your home directory:
   $ python setup.py install --home=~


* What Gets Installed

The main set of files to be installed are all in the "telarchive" directory
(a Python "package") inside the distribution.  These can be installed
automatically via the "setup.py" script or by manually copying the
telarchive directory (see below).

There is also an example script, "dosearch.py", which can be used to run a
search.  This will also be automatically installed via the setup.py script, or
can be manually installed somewhere convenient.  (In the examples below, and
in the internal help text, it's assumed that a symbolic link named
"telarchive" points to the actual dosearch.py script.)


* Automated Installation -- Sitewide

The setup.py file can be used to do an automated installation (via the 
Python distutils package):

$ python setup.py install

A "default" installation will place the telarchive directory in the default
system directory for Python libraries (assuming you have root access),
which is usually something like ("2.x" = whatever latest version of Python
2 is installed):
   /usr/local/lib/python2.x/site-packages/

The dosearch.py script will be installed in the default directory for 
programs, which is usually something like:
   /usr/local/bin/


To change the "parent" directory for these installations, you can use the 
"--prefix" option; e.g.:

$ python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/share

The telarchive package will then (in this example) go in:
   /usr/share/lib/python2.x/site-packages/
and the dosearch.py script in:
   /usr/share/bin/


For even finer control, the "--install-purelib" and "--install-scripts" 
options can be used to specify, e.g.:

$ python setup.py install --install-purelib=/usr/share/python/lib \
--install-scripts=/usr/local/bin



* Automated Installation -- Personal/Local

If you don't want to (or can't) install telarchive systemwide, you can 
install it into a local directory -- such as your home directory -- via 
the "--home" option:

$ python setup.py install --home=/alternate/path/

which will place the telarchive directory in:
   /alternate/path/lib/python/
and the dosearch.py script in:
   /alternate/path/bin/

For example, to install everything within your home directory:

$ python setup.py install --home=~

For finer control, you can specify the exact paths for the telarchive 
package and the dosearch.py script via the "--install-purelib" and 
"--install-scripts" options, e.g.:

$ python setup.py install --install-purelib=/home/username/python-libs \
--install-scripts=/home/username/myscripts



For more information on installing, try:

$ python setup.py --help install


NOTE: Since the telarchive package is a single directory of files, you can
also copy the directory to its destination directly.

E.g., if you keep Python files in "/home/username/lib/python":
$ mv telarchive /home/username/lib/python

And then you can copy dosearch.py someplace useful.
