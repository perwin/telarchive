Hola a todos,

I'd like to let people know about a software tool I've been working on, which I
think other people might find useful.  It's basically a command-line script (written
in Python) which simplifies searching various telescope archives to see if they
might have data on a particular astronomical object.  (It won't *get* the data for you,
of course -- for that, you still need to visit the individual archive web pages.  But it
will save you lots of clicking and typing if you just want to find out if there is *any*
data available).

Por ejemplo:

To search for data within a 2-arcminute box centered on the planetary
nebula NGC 7027:

> archive_search "ngc 7027" 2.0

Searching archives for ngc 7027, with search box =  2.0 arcmin...
        ESO Archive: No data found
        HST Archive (at ESO): Data exists! ("A total of 85 were retrieved")
                -- 6 WFPC2, 24 WF, 1 PC, 13 NICMOS, 3 FOC, 25 STIS, 13 FOS
        UKIRT Archive: Data exists! ("A total of 432 were retrieved")
        CFHT Archive: Data exists! ("A total of 213 records were retrieved")
        ING Archive: Data exists! ("A total of 547 were retrieved")
                -- 113 images, 391 spectra, 43 unclassified
        AAT Archive: No data found


As you can see, for *some* archives it is possible to learn a little about what
is there.  For ESO , AAT, and ING, this means spectroscopy, imaging, and/or
polarimetry (latter for ESO and AAT only); for HST, it means the actual instrument
used.

The simplest way to use this is to copy -- or make a symbolic link to -- a shell
script called "archive_search", which is in my ~/bin directory.  Then you can
give it whatever name you like.  Por ejemplo:

> ln -s /home/erwin/bin/archive_search ~/archive_search

There are various options; type "archive_search --help" for a list.

A couple of notes:
   -- accessing the AAT archive is *very* slow.  If your object is northern, you
can speed up the search using the --noaat option.
   -- the script can be run in multi-threaded mode, which makes it faster.  Use:

> archive_search --threads

BUT in that mode, it is hard to interrupt or stop it (Control-C doesn't really
work).

I hope you find it useful -- let me know if you have any questions or problems
with it.

cheers,

Peter
