Telarchive -- Version 2.0 (6 April 2018)
and
Fetchsdss -- Version 1.3 (6 April 2018)

Major update to make telarchive and fetchsdss compatible with Python 3.

Updated SDSS spectroscopic searches to use Data Release 14.

Fixes to make ESO and SMOKA searches correctly parse instrument and mode counts.

Updated Gemini Observatory searches to use 

Coordinate searches ("--coords=") now allow decimal degrees as inputs.

Added "--skip-archives" option to telarchive, to enable skipping of one
or more archives in a search (e.g., when a particular archive or
archives are temporarily inaccessible).

Added aliases for some command-line options (e.g., "--list-archives" is
a synonym for "--archives").

The current code for telarchive is now on Github at

Telarchive -- Version 1.8.3 (3 Dec 2016)

Minor update to restore access to Gemini archive and fix reporting from ESO
archive.



Telarchive -- Version 1.8.2 (30 Nov 2016)

Minor update to restore access to SMOKA.



Telarchive -- Version 1.8.1 (24 June 2016)
and
Fetchsdss -- Version 1.2.4 (24 June 2016)

Updated code in getcoords.py to accomodate small change in Simbad's returned
HTML, thus restoring coordinate lookup.

Fixed bug in fetchsdss which prevented retrieval of multiple fields for a
single query (if number of fields available is <= the number specified by
the "--max" commandline option).



Telarchive -- Version 1.8.0 (30 August 2015)

Added the new, La Palma-based Isaac Newton Group archive, replacing the old 
ING archive server which didn't include new data (and wasn't really working anymore).
Also restored proper access for both CFHT and UKIRT (now using CADC searches
for both).

Unfortunately, the NOAO archive now uses a JavaScript-based interface which
telarchive can't handle, so I have (temporarily, at least) removed it from
the list of archives that telarchive attempts to query.

 

Telarchive -- Version 1.7.5 (9 May 2015)

Minor updates to restore coordinate lookup via SIMBAD, correct parsing
of results from certain archives, and to include optical SDSS spectra
from SDSS DR12.



Telarchive -- Version 1.7.4 (20 March 2015)

Minor updates to restore access to Gemini Science Archive and AAT Archive.
Automatic timeout (30sec) added to deal with non-responding archives; this
can be altered using the --timeout command-line option.



Telarchive -- Version 1.7.3 (9 April 2014)
and
Fetchsdss -- Version 1.2.2 (9 April 2014)

Minor updates to restore access to search and retrieval of SDSS
spectra and correct parsing of ESO archive results.  Added --nosuffix
option to fetchsdss (tells fetchsdss to *not* include the run and field
numbers in the output filenames)



Fetchsdss -- Version 1.2.1 (11 Nov 2013)

Minor update to fetchsdss to ensure it retrieves DR10 files instead of DR9;
correct retrieval of tsField files (for DR7 data) when run number is less
than 1000.



Telarchive -- Version 1.7 (21 Sept 2013)
and
Fetchsdss -- Version 1.2 (21 Sept 2013)

Both programs updated to work with SDSS DR10 as well as DR7; includes
searching for SDSS DR10 spectra within 10 arcsec of object/coordinate
position.

New script fetchsdss_spectra.py to retrieve SDSS DR10 spectra.



Telarchive -- Version 1.6.6 (7 March 2013)

Minor update to telarchive to restore access to (and proper parsing of) ESO
archive searches.



Telarchive -- Version 1.6.5 (1 September 2011)
and
Fetchsdss -- Version 1.1 (1 September 2011)

Updates to telarchive to restore funcationality of coordinate lookup via
SIMBAD, Spitzer archive searches, and SMOKA archive searches (instrument
counting is currently not working); HST archive searches switched from
ESO (ST-ECF, now deprecated) to STScI archive.

The same coordinate-lookup fix has been applied to fetchsdss; fetchsdss
also has new "--getfirst" and "--getlast" options to retrieve the first
or last field if multiple fields are available.



Telarchive -- Version 1.6.1 (29 May 2010)

Various minor bugfixes to telarchive, including missing regex in 
archive_analyze.findNReturned which was causing failed detections for 
ESO and HST-ESO archives.

--archive=<archive_name> now uses SIMBAD coordinate lookup (as is the
case for searching all archives); requesting that an individual archive to
its own coordinate lookup for a target name is no longer possible.

(Of interest only if you have worked on modifying telarchive code in the
past: The AnalyzeHTML() interface no longer takes a second,
"textSearches" argument, the textSearches data member of archive classes
no longer exists, and the MakeTextSearches() method of basic_archive.py
is gone as well.)



Telarchive -- Version 1.6.0 (10 April 2010)
and
Fetchsdss -- Version 1.0.2 (10 April 2010):

Telarchive now includes an archive for searching Spitzer obervations.

Bugfix of fetchsdss "--max" option (now works properly); minor bugfixe
in utils.py and input-checking in fetchsdss.



Telarchive -- Version 1.5.1 (6 May 2009)
and
Fetchsdss -- Version 1.0.1 (6 May 2009):

Minor changes to SIMBAD-querying code (getcoords.py) to account for changes
in how SIMBAD formats its HTML output, which were preventing us from correctly
reading object coordinates.



Telarchive -- Version 1.5 (12 April 2009)
and
Fetchsdss -- Version 1.0 (12 April 2009):

Both programs updated to work with SDSS DR7 (using new archive module
sdss_coords_archive.py).

Telarchive (archive_search.py) and fetchsdss now use optparse module to
handle command-line parsing, allowing more flexible command-line use
(options and arguments can now be interspersed).  This does require Python
2.3 or higher, but we're assuming almost no one is still using version 2.2
or earlier.

Extensive changes to fetchsdss.py, mainly to allow retrieval of DR7 data:
   -- We now retrieve individual images one-by-one, and downloaded filenames
   have both the run number and field number appended if the user
   supplies a root name (otherwise files have their full SDSS names).
   -- New retrieval options include *not* getting the tsField FITS
   tables, getting JPEGs in addition to or instead of FITS images, and
   specifying a maximum number of separate fields to retrieve (useful
   for cases where dozens of repeat observations exist, as in Stripe 82).
   Note that the default maximum is 1, so that coordinates with multiple
   observations are not automatically retrieved; the user has to specify
   a maximum number (this is to prevent suprise downloads of 60+ fields
   if the requested coordinates lie within a high-repeat area).
   -- Downloaded .tar.gz file bundles are no longer available

Various minor fixes and updates to eso_archive.py [more accurate
instrument counting, IFU and MOS categories added to output listing],
hst_eso_archive.py [more accurate instrument counting], mast_archive.py
[now includes XMM Optical Monitor searches], and smoka_archive.py [now
includes MITSuME robotic telescopes].
