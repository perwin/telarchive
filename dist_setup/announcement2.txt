Hola a todos,

I've recently updated my archive-searching script with the ability to search based
on coordinates as well as object names.  So I thought this might be a good time to
remind people about the script -- or to let new people know about its existence...

It's basically a command-line script (written in Python) which simplifies searching
various telescope archives to see if they might have data on a particular astronomical
object.  This includes the HST archive, as well as the ING, ESO, UKIRT, CFHT, and AAT
ground-based archives.  It won't *get* the data for you, of course, or even tell you much
about it -- for that, you still need to visit the individual archive web pages.  But it
will save you lots of clicking and typing if you just want to find out if there is *any*
data available.

Por ejemplo:

To search for data within a 2-arcminute box centered on the planetary
nebula NGC 7027:

> archive_search "ngc 7027" 2.0

Searching archives for ngc 7027, with search box =  2.0 arcmin...
        ESO Archive: No data found
        HST Archive (at ESO): Data exists! ("A total of 85 were retrieved")
                -- 6 WFPC2, 24 WF, 1 PC, 13 NICMOS, 3 FOC, 25 STIS, 13 FOS
        UKIRT Archive: Data exists! ("A total of 517 were retrieved")
        CFHT Archive: Data exists! ("A total of 213 records were retrieved")
        ING Archive: Data exists! ("A total of 577 were retrieved")
                -- 143 images, 391 spectra, 43 unclassified
        AAT Archive: No data found


otro ejemplo:

To search for data within a 6-minute box centered on RA = 02:27:37.7, Dec = -01:09:17
(J2000 coordinates assumed):

> archive_search --coords="02 27 37.7 -01 09 17" 6.0

Searching archives for RA=02 27 37.7, dec=-01 09 17, with search box =  6.0 arcmin...
        UKIRT Archive: No data found
        ING Archive: Data exists! ("A total of 14 were retrieved")
                -- 11 images, 3 spectra
        HST Archive (at ESO): Data exists! (One observation/association)
        CFHT Archive: No data found
        AAT Archive: Data exists! ("A total of 2 were retrieved")
                -- 0 images, 2 spectra, 0 polarimetry
        ESO Archive: Data exists! ("A total of 382 were found")
                -- 132 images, 250 spectra, 0 polarimetry


As you can see, for *some* archives it is possible to learn a little about what
is there.  For ESO , AAT, and ING, this means spectroscopy, imaging, and/or
polarimetry (latter for ESO and AAT only); for HST, it usually means the actual
instrument used.

The simplest way to use this is to copy -- or make a symbolic link to -- a shell
script called "archive_search", which is in my /home/erwin/bin directory.
Then you can give it whatever name you like.  Por ejemplo:

> ln -s /home/erwin/bin/archive_search ~/archive_search

There are various options; type "archive_search --help" for a list.

Some notes:
   -- the default shell script ("archive_search") is set up for Solaris machines;
if you want to use this on a Linux machine, just use (or copy or link)
/home/erwin/bin/archive_search_linux

   -- accessing the AAT archive is often very slow.  If your object is northern, you
can probably speed up the search using the "--noaat" option.

   -- the script normally runs in multi-threaded mode, which makes it faster. 
BUT it is rather hard to interrupt or stop it (Control-C doesn't really work), due to
peculiarities in Python's threading implementation.  If you like the ability to
interrupt things easily, you can run the script with threading turned off, using
the "--nothreading" option on the command-line.

I hope you find it useful -- let me know if you have any questions or problems
with it.  The coordinate-based search mode is new, and might still have some
bugs, so please tell me if it misbehaves!

cheers,

Peter
