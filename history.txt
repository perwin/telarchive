fetchsdss -- 4 Aug 2010:

Modified fetchsdss.py to include --getfirst options (retrieve first of multiple
fields only).

Removed "--dochecks" option, since SDSS archive server seems to be
consistently describing tsField tables as "ASCII".


telarchive/fetchsdss -- 29 May 2010:

Fixed missing regex in archive_analyze.findNReturned which was causing failed
detections for ESO and HST-ESO archives.

Removed special "not using SDSS" processing from archive_search.py.  This
means that *all* searches will now do SIMBAD coordinate lookup, and the
user *cannot* specify (even unintentionally) a search which asks the
individual archives to do their own coordinate lookup.  (In the future, we
might restore this as an option, but only after cleaning up the HTML-parsing
code.)

Removed "textSearches" option from archives and achive_analyze.html (TextSearches
class has been commented out).  The only thing textSearches was being used
for was testing to see if archives succeeded or failed in their own coordinate
lookup (target name resolution); since we no longer allow direct target-name
searches (see above), this code is not used any more.  The code in question
was rather out-of-date and causing problems when it was being used, and the
back-and-forth nature of where it was defined and used was confusing.

Updated regression-test comparison files in testing/.

telarchive version bumped to 1.6.1



telarchive/fetchsdss -- 3--5 May 2009:

Tweaked getcoords.py: updated regex code for finding parameters in HTML
output of SIMBAD to account for minor changes in output format.

Telarchive version number updated to 1.5.1.
(Fetchsdss version number updated to 1.0.1.)



fetchsdss -- 24 Mar--12 April 2009:

Created new SDSS archive module (sdss_coords_archive.py) to deal with new
DR7 interface for coordinate searches.

Created get_sdssfiles.py module to hold code related to retrieving
individual image files from SDSS DAS (apparently the only way to get
DR7 data); also created get_sdssfiles_unittest.py

Numerous updates to fetchsdss.py to accomodate new archive, new search
options (optionally *not* getting tsField file, getting JPEG only instead
of in addition, etc.), new interface to get_sdssfiles.py, etc.

Added extra tests to fetchsdss_unittest.py.

Updated various archive-module unit tests to account for changes in
output formatting, new observations in archives.

Version number updated to 1.0.


telarchive -- 3--6 Oct 2008/24 Mar--12 April 2009:
[Oct 2008]
Converted archive_search.py to use optparse for handling command-line options.
Prior version of archive_search.py is now called archive_search_orig.py

Updated hst_eso_archive.py to search for instrument names on a line-by-line
basis (new function SearchLines() added) -- previously, we used re.findall()
to search the whole block of HTML, but got fooled and overcounted when the
instrument name was listed more than once per line.

[Mar/April 2009]
Added "XMM-OM" (XMM Optical Monitor) as a mission in mast_archive.py.

Updated to use sdss_coords_archive.py for SDSS searching.

Minor fix to archive_analyze.py to account for changed wording in SMOKA
"can't resolve object name" text.

Minor fixes to instrument-counting code (mostly to re objects) in eso_archive.py
to better count instruments (e.g., counting "IMAGE,JITTER" as well as just "IMAGE";
also now counting IFU and MOS separately).

Updates to smoka_archive.py: changed coordinate-processing to eliminate spaces
between coordinate pieces [despite what help pages say, archive complains if
there are spaces]; added MTO and MTA imagers.

Version number updated to 1.5.


Thanks to Maximilian Fabricius for identifying a bug in the SDSS searches.




telarchive and fetchsdss -- 31 Mar--3 April 2008:

Updated cfht_archive.py to use new URL and form entries; also converted to
use multipart/form posting, which is now the default method used by the CFHT
archive web page.  As with the Gemini archive module, we now define a new
class derived from the basic_archive class.

Also added instrument processing for cfht_archive.py *and* gemini_archive.py:
HTML returned by archive server is now analyzed to create a list of instruments
and # exposures.

Updated gemini_archive_unittest.py and cfht_archive_unittest.py to use current
values for M83 or NGC 4321 (resp.) and to test instrument-counting.

Fixed archive URL in smoka_archive.py; searches done with SMOKA now work again.

Updated "object coordinates not found" text snippets in archive_analyze.py

Reworked mast_archive.py to delete redefined AnalyzeHTML method; moved relevant
search text into archive_analyze.py and fixed things so that failed SIMBAD/NED
coordinate lookups are recognized, if we're using non-SDSS mode.

Modified archive_analyze.py to print standardized "# observations found" text
for each archive, instead of quoting their individual text.

Changed a few old-style class definitions to new-style classes (derived from
"object").

Updated reference files used by do_regressiontests.sh (search_n936_output.txt,
etc.).

Updated version number to 1.4.



telarchive and fetchsdss -- 30 Mar 2008:

Updated footprint_archive.py to use SDSS DR6 footprint server; added
footprint_archive_unittest.py.  Changed fetchsdss.py to use footprint_archive
by default instead of sdss_sql_archive (bcs. footprint server finds fields
which happen to lack any SDSS catalog objects, which SQL server would miss).

Added "--sql" option to fetchsdss.py to use SDSS SQL server instead of
footprint server for coordinate searches, in case something goes wrong
with footprint server.

Modified module_list.py to use footprint_archive instead of sdss_sql_archive
as the SDSS archive class.  Tweaked archive_list.py to remove some excess
duplication of archive names.  Explicit references to archive module names is
now restricted to module_list.py (except for references to the two HST-archive
module names still in archive_list.py).

Modified do_regressiontest.sh so that "telarchive" is a variable, which
can be changed to point to a local instance of archive_search.py (e.g.,
the one in telarchive_working instead of the system default).



telarchive and fetchsdss -- Oct 2007:

Updated utils.py to allow processing of input coordinates in decimal
degree format; updated utils_unittest.py to include testing this.
Updated fetchsdss help strings to reflect this.

Added "--silent" option to fetchsdss.py, which turns off printint of all
messages except error messages.  Altered fetchsdss.main() to return
dataFound, which is positive if data exist in SDSS archive, zero if data
are not in archive, and negative for errors.

Rationalized return values for fetchsdss.main() so that negative values = 
problems with input or with finding coordinates or contacting server; 0 = 
no data; 1 = data found.


telarchive and fetchsdss -- July--Sept 2007:

Updated SDSS queries to use Data Release 6 instead of DR5.  (Trivial 
modifications of URLs and text messages in sdss_sql_archive.py, 
sdss_das_archive.py, and fetchsdss.py).

Fixed erroneous URL for old ING archive.

Updated version number to 1.3.


telarchive -- 22 Feb 2006:

Modifications to dist_setup/README.txt to make personalized installations
easier.

Added a "scripts" specification to dist_setup/setup.py, so that 
dosearch.py is automatically installed as part of the general installation.


telarchive -- 26 Mar--July 2006 (v1.01):

Modified archive_list.py so that ArchiveList() handles doAAT and doSDSS
keywords as though they were boolean (can be 0 or False, 1 or True), 
instead of assuming they must be 0 or 1.

Modified archive_analyze.py to include checking ESO archive replies for 
single-exposure responses, which were previouly missed.

Modified hst_eso_archive.py to add an additional check for WFPC2 exposures 
(when archive returns single-exposure page, formatting is different).

Updated testing/search_n4321_output.txt [more data at ESO now]

Tweaked do_regressiontests.sh to use *local* testing subdirectory.

Initial work on version of archive_search.py which uses optparse module to 
handle command-line options (instead of older getopt module) -- currently 
called "archive_search2.py"

Added history.txt file to keep list of change comments.

Updated SDSS-related files to use DR5 instead of DR4.


telarchive -- 10 Dec 2006:

Updated simbad_archive.py and getcoords.py to use new Simbad interface
(SIMBAD4).


telarchive -- 15--25 Feb 2007 (v1.0.2):

Fixed missing "ukirt" entry in shorthand_dict (module_list.py)

Updated ukirt_archive.py to account for modified URL, parameters in 
archive web page (URL slightly different; RA and Dec labels are now "ra" 
and "dec"; submissions requires "mode=html_summary")

Updated README and other files to mention problems with ING archive.


telarchive -- 27 Feb 2007 (v1.1):

Added preliminary support for Gemini Science Archive and
SMOKA (just counting number of hits, no clever analysis yet).

Added smoka_archive_unittest.py.

Cosmetic fixes to comments (updating copyright dates, etc.);
updated version-number string in archive_search.py;
removed archive_search2.py from included modules of distribution.

Updated browser masquerade to "Mozilla/5.0"


[Later the same day:]
Fixes to smoka_archive.py and smoka_archive_unittest.py to handle
coordinate-based searches properly (SMOKA requires an empty "object" 
field, among other things).

Updates to distribution files (MANIFEST.in, README.txt, setup.py).

Officially called "rc1" ("Release Candidate 1"; version string in
archive_search.py).


telarchive -- 7 May 2007 (v1.1.1):

Switched ING archive URL to 
"http://archive.ast.cam.ac.uk//cgi-bin/wdb/ingarch/ingarch/query"
which is now working!  This is the "old" interface, which only tracks
data up to about 2001, but is at least usable.

Now called "1.1.1".


telarchive/fetchsdss.py -- 8 May 2007 (v0.7):

Updated command-line interface to be somewhat simpler to use (filter-list 
not required; we default to "ugriz" if it's not supplied; etc.).


telarchive + fetchsdss.py -- 6 June 2007 (v1.2):

Updated MANIFEST.in and README.txt to include fetchsdss.py and related 
modules.  Added README_fetchsdss.txt file and do_fetchsdss.py [sample 
script to run fetchsdss.py without needing to know precise location of 
fetchsdss.py].

Updated telarchive package version to 1.2


telarchive -- 19 June 2007 (v1.2):

Updated version-string constant in archive_search.py to "1.2"
